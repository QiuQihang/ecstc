PEARSON = Pearson Coefficient of true (x) versus estimated (y)

MISCLASSIFICATION = % of n(n-1) pairs for which the relative order is
reversed in the estimate.

STD_MEAN = Mean (over all vertices) of the Means (over all trees) of
the normalized Standard Deviation of the vertex's estimated measure
(over the set of completions)--where the normalization is percentized
(100) relative to mean of the vertex's estimates in the set of
completions.

STD_VERTEX_MEAN__STD = Standard deviation (over all vertices) of the
Means (over all trees) of the normalized Standard Deviation of the
vertex measures (over the set of completions)--where the normalization
is percentized (100) relative to the mean of the estimates over the
set of completions.

WORST_VERTEX_MEAN__STD = the maximum (over all vertices) of the
Means (over all trees) of the normalized Standard Deviation of the
vertex measures (over the set of completions)--where the normalization
is percentized (100) relative to the mean of the estimates over the
set of completions.

Note, in the above "Means (over all trees)" is a trivial computation
when the number of trees is 1.
